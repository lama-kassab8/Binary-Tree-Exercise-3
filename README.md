# Binary Tree Traversal in Python

This project demonstrates how to implement and traverse a simple binary tree in Python using three standard traversal methods:
- **In-order** (left → root → right)
- **Pre-order** (root → left → right)
- **Post-order** (left → right → root)

## Files

- `tree_traversal.py`: Contains the code for the `Node` and `BinaryTree` classes, and prints the tree traversals.

## What’s Inside?

      5
     / \
    3   7

Given the above tree, the output will be:
In-order:
3 5 7

Post-order:
3 7 5

Pre-order:
5 3 7
